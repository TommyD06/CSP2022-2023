    <h1>   This project, named "Snowman Explosion", consisted of Frosty the Snowman being built into a grassy terrain and immediately hit by a meteor. This meteor explodes Frosty into three pieces, while sending him into space. In space, he floates over to Mars, where, because of the lack of an atmosphere, melts.

    <p1> In the 1.2.5 Project, my parner and I created the "Higher or Lower Game". In this game, a contestant is told to set a maximum value, and begin guessing numbers that fall in the range. After each guess, the contestant is told whether to make their next guess higher or lower until they reach a designated number.

    <p1> In the 1.3.1 Project, my partner and I created an E-Card for an individual in a retirement home. When you first open the card, a "Happy Retirement" message appears, with instructions to press the enter key when ready. This process repeats multiple times, each time with a different image and message, until one final one appears with the message. "We wish you a fantastic retirement!!!"

    <p1> My partner and I created a game in Scratch in which a character from the Minions movie will randomly appear on the screen, and it is the player's job to guide a rocket towards it. Each time the rocket enters the character's hit-box, it will be "grabbed", and a counter will increase by one.
